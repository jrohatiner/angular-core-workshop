# Angular 7 NRWL Starter

Angular CLI and NRWL Extensions are used to streamline development.

Follow the steps below to get started!

## Getting Started

An Nx workspace is an Angular CLI project. Install the Angular CLI globally using npm or yarn.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

> Note: If you do not have the Angular CLI installed globally you may not be able to use ng from the terminal to run CLI commands within the project. But the package.json file comes with npm scripts to run ng commands, so you can run npm start to ng serve and you can run npm run ng <command> to run any of the ng commands.

After you have installed the Angular CLI, install `@nrwl/schematics`.

```
npm install -g @nrwl/schematics
```

After installing it you can create a new Nx workspace by running:

```
create-nx-workspace angular-core-workshop
```

Have at it!
